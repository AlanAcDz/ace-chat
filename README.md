# AceChat 🚀

**Self-hostable, privacy-focused, and powerful AI chat application.**

AceChat is an open-source chat application inspired by `t3chat`, designed to be fully self-hostable on low-power devices like a Raspberry Pi. Our core philosophy emphasizes data privacy, user ownership, and high performance in a resource-constrained environment.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Self-Hosting with Docker)

The recommended way to run AceChat is with Docker. It's fast, easy, and isolates the environment.

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### Installation

1.  **Get the Code**
    Clone or download this repository to your local machine and navigate into the project directory.

2.  **Configure Environment Variables**
    Create a `.env` file by copying the example file. This file will hold your configuration.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    You can open `.env` and modify variables like `POSTGRES_USER`, `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`, or `APP_PORT` if needed. The defaults are fine for a standard setup.

3.  **Launch the Application**
    Use Docker Compose to build and start the services.

    ```bash
    docker compose up -d
    ```

    This command builds the app's Docker image and starts the application and database containers in the background. The first time you run this, it might take a few minutes to download and build everything.

4.  **Access AceChat**
    Your self-hosted AI chat is now running! Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` (or the custom `APP_PORT` you set). The first user to sign up will be granted administrative privileges.

### Managing the Application

- **To stop the application:**
  ```bash
  docker compose down
  ```
- **To view logs:**
  ```bash
  docker compose logs -f app
  ```

### 🌐 Accessing AceChat from Anywhere with Tailscale

Want to use your self-hosted chat from outside your home network? [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/) creates a secure, private network between your devices, making it easy to access AceChat from anywhere.

1.  **Install Tailscale on Your Server**: Follow the [Tailscale installation guide](https://tailscale.com/download) for your server's operating system (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows).

2.  **Start Tailscale**: After installing, authenticate and start the Tailscale service on your server.

    ```bash
    sudo tailscale up
    ```

3.  **Install Tailscale on Your Other Devices**: Install the Tailscale app on your other devices (laptop, phone, etc.) and log in using the same account.

4.  **Find Your Server's Tailscale IP**: In your server's terminal, run the following command to see its Tailscale IP address.

    ```bash
    tailscale ip -4
    ```

    It will look something like `100.x.x.x`.

5.  **Connect from Anywhere**: Open a browser on your phone or laptop and navigate to `http://<YOUR_SERVER_TAILSCALE_IP>:3000` (or your custom port). You now have secure access to your private AI chat from anywhere in the world!

## �� Local Development

If you want to contribute to the project or run it directly on your machine.

### Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/docs/installation)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) (for the database)

### Installation

1.  **Get the code and install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    # Make sure you are in the project's root directory
    bun install
    ```

2.  **Set up the environment file:**

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    The default `DATABASE_URL` is already configured for the local Docker database.

3.  **Start the database container:**

    ```bash
    bun run db:dev
    ```

4.  **Run database migrations:**
    Apply the database schema to your local database.

    ```bash
    bun run db:migrate
    ```

5.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    bun run dev
    ```
    The application will be available at the address shown in your terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173`).

### Useful Scripts

- `bun run dev`: Start the development server.
- `bun run build`: Build the app for production.
- `bun run check`: Type-check the code with Svelte Check.
- `bun run lint`: Lint the code with ESLint.
- `bun run format`: Format code with Prettier.
- `bun run db:studio`: Open Drizzle Studio to browse your database.
